Uturn Demo 
This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

2024-02-20 	Michael Faraday and the founding of electrical engineering	The IEC Academy team is pleased to invite you to the first webinar of the Meet the author series for 2024, where we commemorate the 200th anniversary of Michael Faraday, a big name in the history of electricity, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society:
We will welcome during this webinar conversation Frank James, author of Michael Faraday: A Very Short Introduction, to talk with us about Faraday’s life, work and legacy.
This illustrated talk will trace Faraday’s life from his birth in 1791 to a Sandemanian blacksmith, through his time as an apprentice bookbinder, to his appointment as laboratory assistant in the Royal Institution (in central London) and his subsequent promotion there to Fullerian Professor of Chemistry.
Faraday’s work at the Royal Institution can now be seen as having discovered the principles of the electric motor, transformer and generator. He later formulated the field theory of electro-magnetism which in the hands of Maxwell, Einstein and others became and remains one of the cornerstones of modern physics. By the end of the nineteenth century these discoveries would form the basis of electrical engineering.
However, Faraday during his lifetime also worked to apply his results to practical problems especially in the electrification of lighthouses and in the theory of long-distance telegraph signalling. He was perhaps the most famous man of science during the middle third of the nineteenth century, but following his death in 1867 he was buried with ‘no ceremony’ in the Sandemanian plot in Highgate cemetery in north London.
This webinar will be of interest to anyone curious about the history of electrotechnology, including students currently starting their own engineering journeys.	•	14:00 Registration

2024-02-14 	Resistance measurement method on the thermoformable conducting layer (IEC 62899-202-10)	This 60-minute webinar will introduce IEC TC 119’s work on Printed Electronics and the most recent standard that was developed in this TC.

IEC 62899-202-10 is the first-ever standard on in-mould electronics (IME) technology. The standard defines the terminology and measurement methods for characterizing the resistance change of conductive ink layers as a function of thermoplastic elongation.
Creating smart functional electronics with IME technology requires thermoforming, i.e. creating 3D shapes from flat 2D functional films with printed circuitry and mounted components. Thermoforming elongates the printed layers causing resistivity changes that should be considered during the design phase. Using a standardized measurement method ensures comparability of the results and leads to optimization of the designs/materials.

This webinar will give participants an overview of the in-mould electronics technology, and the measurement method.
This session is part of our series of webinars focusing on new publications, covering new standards, guides, reports, white papers and other important publications relevant to standards users.	•	13:00 Video

2024-02-01 	Mineral insulating oils in electrical equipment – Supervision and maintenance guidance (IEC 60422)	Join this webinar for a review of the changes in the latest edition of IEC 60422; Mineral insulating oils in electrical equipment – Supervision and maintenance guidance.

For asset managers and operators of electrical plants filled with mineral oil, IEC 60422 is the “go-to” document for guidance on the condition of the insulating liquid and to some extent the plant itself, the recommended actions help end users to plan interventions and maintenance activities accordingly.

This webinar will discuss the latest revision of the document, review the changes in guidance, and highlight the new layout which will allow users to go straight to the information they require for a specific plant item.

2024-01-31 	Standards Collaboration on Data Use in Smart Cities (ISO/IEC JTC 1 workshop)	The seminar aimed to discuss international standardization collaboration solutions about data use in smart cities. It provided an opportunity to exchange and share international experiences and best practices on multi-dimensional data use citywide. The presentations and discussions in the seminar included:
1. What standardization activities have taken place on data use to support data-based, data-driven and data-enabled ICT development and applications,
2. What challenges are facing for data use in smart cities,
3. What solutions would be appropriate for data use in smart cities from city wide multi-stakeholder’s interests.

2024-01-25 	Marking the first International Day of Clean Energy	On 25 August 2023, the UN General Assembly (GA) through its resolution (A/RES/77/327) proclaimed 26 January as the International Day of Clean Energy.
The resolution “Invites all Member States, organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant international organizations to collaborate on the celebration of the International Day of Clean Energy”.
With the above resolution in mind, the IEC Academy is offering this webinar discussion to mark this first ever celebration of the International Day of Clean Energy. The event will delve into crucial topics that resonate with the global community such as renewable energy solutions, energy access and inclusivity, global impact, and how the IEC, through its Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems, contributes to promoting universal access to sustainable energy, enhance energy efficiency, and increase the use of renewable energy sources.
This webinar will also be an opportunity for the Academy to launch its latest webinar series centred around the four IEC Conformity Assessment (CA) Systems, and entitled The world of IEC CA services.
